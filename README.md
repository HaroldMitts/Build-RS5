#### IMPORTANT: As the result of a serious issue and to be on the safe side, Microsoft has removed the 1809 OPK until a resolution can be found.

##### While Microsoft investigates this issue, they have taken the extra precaution of pulling all media. Product builds are no longer available on Microsoft's Software Order Center (SOC). 

##### For OEMs that have previously downloaded the builds from SOC, builds can continue to be used for clean install only, since the issue does not impact clean installs.  However, OEMs cannot use media to create recovery media disks and may not distribute this build in any way other than pre-installed on systems.
